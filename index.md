        <h1> Welcome! I'm glad you're here! </h1>
        <p> My name is Kim. I'm interested in sustainability, education, and anti-capitalist action. </p>
        <p> While I enjoy coding and computer science, my goals don't include working for a tech-start up or having a career in computer science.
        </p>
        <p> I'll use this site to share resources and information relating to the 2020 pandemic and uprisings against fascism, as well as to seek collaboration on personal projects! </p>
